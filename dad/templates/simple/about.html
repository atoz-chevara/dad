<h2 class="title">About this site</h2>

<p>
The main purpose of this website is to allow people to thank package
maintainers and developers for making Debian possible. It was inspired
by the <strong>"Debian Appreciation Day"</strong> created in 2010 by
Margarita Manterola, Maximiliano
Curia, <a href="http://valessiobrito.info">Valessio Brito</a> and
Raphael Geissert.
</p>

<p>
This version was written by <a href="http://comum.org">Lincoln de
Sousa</a> e <a href="http://metaldot.alucinados.com">Marcelo Jorge
Vieira</a> and has some novelties such as users' location and images
sharing.  Besides bringing knowledge about how Debian users are spread
around the world it will also feed a repository of free images that can
be used for promoting Debian in the future.
